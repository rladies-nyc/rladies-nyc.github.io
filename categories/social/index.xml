      <description>[Please note: At the request of members of our community for an R-Ladies space exclusively for minority genders, this event is limited to those who identify as such (including but not limited to women, trans men, non-binary, and gender nonconforming individuals). Male allies have been great supporters of our chapter and the R-Ladies mission to promote gender diversity in the R Community &amp;ndash; for which we are grateful! &amp;ndash; and we believe the best way male allies can support us this month is by honoring the need for and benefit of such a space.</description>
