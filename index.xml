&lt;p&gt;For our August event, we are excited to host Professor Di Cook of Monash University who will be presenting strategies for making plots to explore data using R. There is an interactive component to her talk, and she has requested that attendees download packages tidyverse, plotly, forcats, and nullabor from CRAN, as well as yowie from Github using remotes::install_github(&amp;ldquo;numbats/yowie&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event will be hosted over Zoom, and the link will be available on this Meetup page at noon on the day of the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agenda (times approximate):
7-7:05 pm: R-Ladies NYC Announcements
7:05-7:50: &amp;ldquo;Making plots to explore data using R&amp;rdquo;
7:50-8:15: Questions and wrap-up&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Talk Abstract &amp;mdash;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract: A recent article by Hullman and Gelman appeared in the Harvard Data Science Review (&lt;a href=&#34;https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/w075glo6&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/w075glo6&lt;/a&gt;) arguing the need for more theoretical work to support interactive exploratory graphics. It is accompanied by six short informative commentaries. Plots have always been an instrument for data exploration, and yet it is a difficult task, to teach and to conduct. Here we will give a walk-through on organizing your work to make plots to explore data and to quantitatively check if what you see is spurious or special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Bio &amp;mdash;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bio: Dianne Cook is Professor of Business Analytics at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. Her research is in the area of data visualization, especially the visualization of high-dimensional data using tours with low-dimensional projections, and projection pursuit. A current focus is on bridging the gap between exploratory graphics and statistical inference. Di utilizes technology such as virtual environments, Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, and eye-tracking in her work, and makes an effort to share her work with open-source software. Di is a Fellow of the American Statistical Association, elected member of the International Statistical Institute, past-editor of the Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, elected Member of the R Foundation, and current editor of the R Journal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;details&#34;&gt;Details&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our July event, we are excited to host authors Neale Batra, Aminata Ndiaye, and Paula Blomquist, who will present the Epidemiologist R Handbook, a free new code reference book targeted to R users working in applied epidemiology and public health, but handy for anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event will be hosted over Zoom, and the link will be available on this Meetup page at noon on the day of the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agenda (times approximate):
7-7:05 pm: R-Ladies NYC Announcements
7:05-7:50: &amp;ldquo;The Epidemiologist R Handbook - a new resource for public health practitioners (and everyone else)&amp;rdquo;
7:50-8:15: Questions and wrap-up&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Talk Abstract &amp;mdash;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, 50 epidemiologists from across the world joined forces seeking to improve access to R and elevate the quality of analytics in public health. Writing in their spare time, they produced The Epidemiologist R Handbook (epiRhandbook.com), a free new code reference book targeted to R users working in applied epidemiology and public health, but handy for anyone. The &amp;ldquo;Epi R Handbook&amp;rdquo; is full of code snippets and tutorials addressing day-to-day data cleaning, analysis, visualization, reporting, and collaboration challenges. The handbook also comes in an offline version for use in settings with low internet connectivity. Since its launch, the handbook has been used 200,000 times by 36,000 people in 203 countries/territories. In this session, founder Neale Batra is joined by co-authors Paula Blomquist and Aminata Ndiaye to discuss the handbook&amp;rsquo;s utility for you, the intersection of R and public health, the project&amp;rsquo;s next steps, and the editorial and technical challenges they faced creating this resource for the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Bios &amp;mdash;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neale Batra is the founder and editor of the Epidemiologist R Handbook project. As an applied epidemiologist, he tries to leverage R to better inform decision-making in health emergencies. Currently he works for the COVID-19 analytics team at the World Health Organization (Geneva), but has previously worked internationally for Doctors without Borders and in the US for the public health departments of Philadelphia and Santa Clara County. He loves teaching, and in his spare time enjoys guiding rock climbing and backpacking trips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paula Blomquist is an epidemiologist in Public Health England, where she works on the national surveillance of COVID-19. She spends much of her day job creating data visualisations and R markdown reports to monitor variants, with a particular fondness of {patchwork} and {flextable}. Paula has also used R for analyses in international deployments, most recently with the UK Emergency Medical Team to Samoa during the 2019 measles epidemic. Paula is a contributor to the Epidemiologist R Handbook, and excited to encourage more people in public health to learn to code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aminata NDIAYE is a Biostatistician at Epicentre Research Department-MSF (Doctors without Borders). She graduated from Paris Descartes University School of Medicine in Public health and from Paris Saclay University School of Sciences in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics. She previously worked at World Health Organization (WHO) as an analyst during the 10th Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and at Karolinska Institute’s department of medical epidemiology and biostatistics as a Research assistant.

      <description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;details&#34;&gt;Details&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our June event, R-Ladies Anna Sofia Kircher and Joyce Robbins will share short talks about using color palettes, themes, and schemes to improve data visualization in R.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event will be hosted over Zoom, and the link will be available on this Meetup page at noon on the day of the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agenda (times approximate):
7-7:05 pm: R-Ladies NYC Announcements
7:05-7:30: “ggplot and I” by Anna Sofia Kircher
7:30-7:55: “Does your color palette match your data?” by Joyce Robbins
7:55-8:15: Questions and wrap-up&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Talk Abstract &amp;mdash;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“ggplot and I”
Speaker: Anna Sofia Kircher&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract: This talk will be about how to use ggplot themes and how to personalize them for your purposes. This is motivated by my own obsession with colors and my own experience that different plots with different audiences respond differently to different themes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bio: Anna Sofia Kircher is the data scientist at Lendable and works with data of various fintechs in emerging and frontier markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Does your color palette match your data?”
Speaker: Joyce Robbins&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract: One of the most common graphical mistakes is choosing an inappropriate color scheme for your data. In this talk, I’ll explain how sequential, diverging and qualitative color schemes are each suited to a different type of data. We’ll then look at a variety of plots that could be improved with alternative color choices. My hope is that these examples will serve as conversation starters for a lively discussion on matching color to data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bio: Joyce Robbins (@jtrnyc) is a Lecturer in the Department of Statistics at Columbia University. She specializes in data visualization and statistical literacy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;details&#34;&gt;Details&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our April event, we will have two guest speakers. Megan Robertson will be talking about how to write production level data science code, while Natalie O&amp;rsquo;Shea will be discussing how to use the nyccensus package and how to wrangle/use census data for equity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event will be hosted over Zoom, and the link will be available on this Meetup page at noon on the day of the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agenda (times approximate):
6:05 - 6:10 pm: R-Ladies NYC Announcements
6:10 - 6:40 : Natalie&amp;rsquo;s talk on NYC Census data with time for Q&amp;amp;A
6:40-7pm: Megan&amp;rsquo;s talk on creating production level data science code with time for Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Talk Abstract &amp;mdash;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Introducing nyccensus: Leveraging Census Data for Equity in NYC&amp;rdquo;
Speaker: Natalie O&amp;rsquo;Shea&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract: This talk will introduce the nyccensus package and associated Shiny dashboard and share examples of how census data can be leveraged to help address equity issues. The nyccensus package is a simple data-sharing package meant to ease the pains of accessing and wrangling publicly-available response rate data from the 2020 Decennial Census as well as other relevant demographic data from the American Community Survey at various geographic levels in New York City. I will share some lessons learned and examples of how these data can be used to better understand and address equity issues in NYC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bio: Natalie O&amp;rsquo;Shea is a researcher and data visualization specialist with a passion for equity, accessibility, and human-centered design. She started her data science journey during graduate school, falling in love with all things R in her coursework and research. She was part of CUNY&amp;rsquo;s first Data for Public Good cohort before taking a position as a Community Outreach Data Analyst with the NYC Census 2020 initiative and then working as a Data Visualization Specialist at NYC Test &amp;amp; Trace Corps. She is currently working as a Data Visualization Analyst on the Research and Learning Engineering team at Edmentum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Creating Production Level Data Science Code&amp;rdquo;
Speaker: Megan Robertson&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Writing code is a big part of working as a data scientist. You write code throughout all stages of a project from exploratory data analysis to building models. This talk focuses on creating production code from a proof of concept analysis or model. How do you organize and adapt all the code created to get to a proof of concept? Do you feel overwhelmed by everything you need to do? At the end of this talk you’ll walk away with tips and strategies to make your own production code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bio: Megan Robertson is a Senior Data Scientist at Nike. She has multiple years of experience applying data science in retail settings. She first became interested in math and statistics through sports analytics, and wrote her Master’s thesis in collaboration with an NBA team. Her background includes training in Bayesian methodology, statistical modeling, machine learning and more. Megan has delivered multiple talks on various aspects of data science from building a career and project management to writing code. She is currently writing her first data science book, Mastering Communication in Data Science, in partnership with Manning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Please note: At the request of members of our community for an R-Ladies space exclusively for minority genders, this event is limited to those who identify as such (including but not limited to women, trans men, non-binary, and gender nonconforming individuals). Male allies have been great supporters of our chapter and the R-Ladies mission to promote gender diversity in the R Community &amp;ndash; for which we are grateful! &amp;ndash; and we believe the best way male allies can support us this month is by honoring the need for and benefit of such a space.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Holidays! To close out 2020, we are thrilled to host a virtual version of our annual end-of-year celebration and social! We&amp;rsquo;ll utilize breakout rooms to allow participants to connect (or re-connect) with other members of our community in smaller groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;IMPORTANT&lt;/em&gt; To RSVP for this event, you must complete and submit this Google form: &lt;a href=&#34;https://forms.gle/v3eEg4nXSzH9s5D4A&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://forms.gle/v3eEg4nXSzH9s5D4A&lt;/a&gt; While you may RSVP via Meetup to let others know you plan to attend, Zoom link information will only be shared via email with those who register through the form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;agenda&#34;&gt;Agenda:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;book-description&#34;&gt;Book Description&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data Science in Education Using R is the go-to reference for learning data science in the education field. The book answers questions like: What does a data scientist in education do? How do I get started learning R, the popular open-source statistical programming language? And what does a data analysis project in education look like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re just getting started with R in an education job, this is the book you’ll want with you. This book gets you started with R by teaching the building blocks of programming that you’ll use many times in your career. The book takes a &amp;ldquo;learn by doing&amp;rdquo; approach and offers eight analysis walkthroughs that show you a data analysis from start to finish, complete with code for you to practice with. The book finishes with how to get involved in the data science community and how to integrate data science in your education job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;talk-abstracts&#34;&gt;Talk Abstracts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Text Analysis in R: Gender Bias in Wikipedia Biographies&amp;rdquo;
Speaker: Yipeng Lai&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract: This talk will focus on how to manipulate and analyze textual data in R using the quanteda​ package. Yipeng will go over some basic natural language processing techniques. She will talk you through how to apply these techniques to dissect gender bias in Wikipedia biographies. She finds that biographies about female subjects are more likely to contain terms relating to gender and marriage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bio: Yipeng is an Applied Scientist at StreetEasy, NYC&amp;rsquo;s local real estate marketplace. She just received her MS in Data Science from New York University this summer. She is passionate about natural language processing, data science for social good, and urban data. When she is not working with data, you can find her blogging about food and practicing latte art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;R is for Resilience: Learning R through Data Visualization&amp;rdquo;
Speaker: Stacy Lansey&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract: I will talk about my first R Project, the visualizations for the Warby Parker Impact Report, and how I used the skills I gained to advocate for a shift in the descriptive adjectives associated with female students at my son&amp;rsquo;s school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bio: Stacy Lansey is the Data Science Analyst at Warby Parker. She came to this role from a background in real estate and finance and is speaking about her experiences learning R in this role.&lt;/p&gt;
