&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Talk Abstract &amp;mdash;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract: The tidymodels packages allow users to create and optimize models and their pre-processing steps (e.g. PCA, feature encodings, etc). With new data, it is common to try a variety of models to determine what works best. The workflowsets package enables users to easily evaluate, rank, and even combine (with the stacks package) myriad combinations of models and pre-processors. the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Bio &amp;mdash;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bio: Max Kuhn is a software engineer at RStudio. He is currently working on improving R&amp;rsquo;s modeling capabilities. He was a Senior Director of Nonclinical Statistics at Pfizer Global R&amp;amp;D in Connecticut. He was applying models in the pharmaceutical and diagnostic industries for over 18 years. Max has a Ph.D. in Biostatistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;details&#34;&gt;Details&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our July event, we are excited to host authors Neale Batra, Aminata Ndiaye, and Paula Blomquist, who will present the Epidemiologist R Handbook, a free new code reference book targeted to R users working in applied epidemiology and public health, but handy for anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event will be hosted over Zoom, and the link will be available on this Meetup page at noon on the day of the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agenda (times approximate):
7-7:05 pm: R-Ladies NYC Announcements
7:05-7:50: &amp;ldquo;The Epidemiologist R Handbook - a new resource for public health practitioners (and everyone else)&amp;rdquo;
7:50-8:15: Questions and wrap-up&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Talk Abstract &amp;mdash;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, 50 epidemiologists from across the world joined forces seeking to improve access to R and elevate the quality of analytics in public health. Writing in their spare time, they produced The Epidemiologist R Handbook (epiRhandbook.com), a free new code reference book targeted to R users working in applied epidemiology and public health, but handy for anyone. The &amp;ldquo;Epi R Handbook&amp;rdquo; is full of code snippets and tutorials addressing day-to-day data cleaning, analysis, visualization, reporting, and collaboration challenges. The handbook also comes in an offline version for use in settings with low internet connectivity. Since its launch, the handbook has been used 200,000 times by 36,000 people in 203 countries/territories. In this session, founder Neale Batra is joined by co-authors Paula Blomquist and Aminata Ndiaye to discuss the handbook&amp;rsquo;s utility for you, the intersection of R and public health, the project&amp;rsquo;s next steps, and the editorial and technical challenges they faced creating this resource for the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Bios &amp;mdash;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neale Batra is the founder and editor of the Epidemiologist R Handbook project. As an applied epidemiologist, he tries to leverage R to better inform decision-making in health emergencies. Currently he works for the COVID-19 analytics team at the World Health Organization (Geneva), but has previously worked internationally for Doctors without Borders and in the US for the public health departments of Philadelphia and Santa Clara County. He loves teaching, and in his spare time enjoys guiding rock climbing and backpacking trips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paula Blomquist is an epidemiologist in Public Health England, where she works on the national surveillance of COVID-19. She spends much of her day job creating data visualisations and R markdown reports to monitor variants, with a particular fondness of {patchwork} and {flextable}. Paula has also used R for analyses in international deployments, most recently with the UK Emergency Medical Team to Samoa during the 2019 measles epidemic. Paula is a contributor to the Epidemiologist R Handbook, and excited to encourage more people in public health to learn to code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aminata NDIAYE is a Biostatistician at Epicentre Research Department-MSF (Doctors without Borders). She graduated from Paris Descartes University School of Medicine in Public health and from Paris Saclay University School of Sciences in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics. She previously worked at World Health Organization (WHO) as an analyst during the 10th Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and at Karolinska Institute’s department of medical epidemiology and biostatistics as a Research assistant. She is co-organizer and member of the R-ladies Stockholm group since its creation, in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;details&#34;&gt;Details&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our June event, R-Ladies Anna Sofia Kircher and Joyce Robbins will share short talks about using color palettes, themes, and schemes to improve data visualization in R.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event will be hosted over Zoom, and the link will be available on this Meetup page at noon on the day of the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agenda (times approximate):
7-7:05 pm: R-Ladies NYC Announcements
7:05-7:30: “ggplot and I” by Anna Sofia Kircher
7:30-7:55: “Does your color palette match your data?” by Joyce Robbins
7:55-8:15: Questions and wrap-up&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Talk Abstract &amp;mdash;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“ggplot and I”
Speaker: Anna Sofia Kircher&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract: This talk will be about how to use ggplot themes and how to personalize them for your purposes. This is motivated by my own obsession with colors and my own experience that different plots with different audiences respond differently to different themes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bio: Anna Sofia Kircher is the data scientist at Lendable and works with data of various fintechs in emerging and frontier markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Does your color palette match your data?”
Speaker: Joyce Robbins&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract: One of the most common graphical mistakes is choosing an inappropriate color scheme for your data. In this talk, I’ll explain how sequential, diverging and qualitative color schemes are each suited to a different type of data. We’ll then look at a variety of plots that could be improved with alternative color choices. My hope is that these examples will serve as conversation starters for a lively discussion on matching color to data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bio: Joyce Robbins (@jtrnyc) is a Lecturer in the Department of Statistics at Columbia University. She specializes in data visualization and statistical literacy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;details&#34;&gt;Details&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our April event, we will have two guest speakers. Megan Robertson will be talking about how to write production level data science code, while Natalie O&amp;rsquo;Shea will be discussing how to use the nyccensus package and how to wrangle/use census data for equity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event will be hosted over Zoom, and the link will be available on this Meetup page at noon on the day of the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agenda (times approximate):
6:05 - 6:10 pm: R-Ladies NYC Announcements
6:10 - 6:40 : Natalie&amp;rsquo;s talk on NYC Census data with time for Q&amp;amp;A
6:40-7pm: Megan&amp;rsquo;s talk on creating production level data science code with time for Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Talk Abstract &amp;mdash;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Introducing nyccensus: Leveraging Census Data for Equity in NYC&amp;rdquo;
Speaker: Natalie O&amp;rsquo;Shea&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract: This talk will introduce the nyccensus package and associated Shiny dashboard and share examples of how census data can be leveraged to help address equity issues. The nyccensus package is a simple data-sharing package meant to ease the pains of accessing and wrangling publicly-available response rate data from the 2020 Decennial Census as well as other relevant demographic data from the American Community Survey at various geographic levels in New York City. I will share some lessons learned and examples of how these data can be used to better understand and address equity issues in NYC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bio: Natalie O&amp;rsquo;Shea is a researcher and data visualization specialist with a passion for equity, accessibility, and human-centered design. She started her data science journey during graduate school, falling in love with all things R in her coursework and research. She was part of CUNY&amp;rsquo;s first Data for Public Good cohort before taking a position as a Community Outreach Data Analyst with the NYC Census 2020 initiative and then working as a Data Visualization Specialist at NYC Test &amp;amp; Trace Corps. She is currently working as a Data Visualization Analyst on the Research and Learning Engineering team at Edmentum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Creating Production Level Data Science Code&amp;rdquo;
Speaker: Megan Robertson&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Writing code is a big part of working as a data scientist. You write code throughout all stages of a project from exploratory data analysis to building models. This talk focuses on creating production code from a proof of concept analysis or model. How do you organize and adapt all the code created to get to a proof of concept? Do you feel overwhelmed by everything you need to do? At the end of this talk you’ll walk away with tips and strategies to make your own production code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bio: Megan Robertson is a Senior Data Scientist at Nike. She has multiple years of experience applying data science in retail settings. She first became interested in math and statistics through sports analytics, and wrote her Master’s thesis in collaboration with an NBA team. Her background includes training in Bayesian methodology, statistical modeling, machine learning and more. Megan has delivered multiple talks on various aspects of data science from building a career and project management to writing code. She is currently writing her first data science book, Mastering Communication in Data Science, in partnership with Manning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our March event, Dr. Connie Brett, the CEO, founder, &amp;amp; principal data scientist of Aggregate Genius, Inc. will talk to us about the Periscope package and enterprise-level Shiny apps!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event will be hosted over Zoom, and the link will be available on this Meetup page at noon on the day of the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agenda (times approximate):
6:05 - 6:10 pm: R-Ladies NYC Announcements
6:10 + : Connie&amp;rsquo;s talk on periscope with time for Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Talk Abstract &amp;mdash;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Focus on Content: Create Enterprise-Worthy Shiny Applications with Periscope&amp;rdquo;
Speaker: Dr. Connie Brett&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract: The periscope R package is a framework that you can use to significantly speed up your shiny development – whether you are just writing your first collaborative application or taking on a bigger project that will be deployed to many users. Periscope can significantly &amp;ldquo;up&amp;rdquo; your Shiny game by jump-starting development in a way that is flexible and robust. This lets you focus on the content of your application, as opposed to the mechanics (and those insidious pitfalls!) of building a shiny application for multiple users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bio: Dr. Connie Brett is the CEO, Founder, and Principal Data Scientist of Aggregate Genius Inc. located in BC, Canada. She is experienced in using many types of models and algorithms as well as architecting cutting-edge big-data analytics-integrated platforms. She has submitted publications and patents; contributes to and maintains R packages and frameworks (such as periscope) in the open-source community; and attends and speaks at industry events. With over 20 years spent focusing on producing solid analytical models, software and visualization tools – as well as custom IT solutions architecture – she continues to carry forward her passion for helping clients realize true business insights from analytics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data Science in Education Using R is the go-to reference for learning data science in the education field. The book answers questions like: What does a data scientist in education do? How do I get started learning R, the popular open-source statistical programming language? And what does a data analysis project in education look like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re just getting started with R in an education job, this is the book you’ll want with you. This book gets you started with R by teaching the building blocks of programming that you’ll use many times in your career. The book takes a &amp;ldquo;learn by doing&amp;rdquo; approach and offers eight analysis walkthroughs that show you a data analysis from start to finish, complete with code for you to practice with. The book finishes with how to get involved in the data science community and how to integrate data science in your education job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;details&#34;&gt;Details&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our October event, R-Ladies Yipeng Lai and Stacy Lansey will share short talks on using R for analyzing gender bias on Wikipedia and learning R through data visualization (which motivated an interesting side project on gender).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event will be hosted over Zoom, and the link will be available on this Meetup page at noon on the day of the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;agenda-times-approximate&#34;&gt;Agenda (times approximate):&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7-7:05 pm: R-Ladies NYC Announcements&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7:05-7:30: &amp;ldquo;Text Analysis in R: Gender Bias in Wikipedia Biographies&amp;rdquo; by Yipeng Lai&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7:30-7:55: &amp;ldquo;R is for Resilience: Learning R through Data Visualization&amp;rdquo; by Stacy Lansey&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7:55-8:15: Questions and wrap-up&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;talk-abstracts&#34;&gt;Talk Abstracts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Text Analysis in R: Gender Bias in Wikipedia Biographies&amp;rdquo;
Speaker: Yipeng Lai&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract: This talk will focus on how to manipulate and analyze textual data in R using the quanteda​ package. Yipeng will go over some basic natural language processing techniques. She will talk you through how to apply these techniques to dissect gender bias in Wikipedia biographies. She finds that biographies about female subjects are more likely to contain terms relating to gender and marriage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bio: Yipeng is an Applied Scientist at StreetEasy, NYC&amp;rsquo;s local real estate marketplace. She just received her MS in Data Science from New York University this summer. She is passionate about natural language processing, data science for social good, and urban data. When she is not working with data, you can find her blogging about food and practicing latte art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;R is for Resilience: Learning R through Data Visualization&amp;rdquo;
Speaker: Stacy Lansey&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract: I will talk about my first R Project, the visualizations for the Warby Parker Impact Report, and how I used the skills I gained to advocate for a shift in the descriptive adjectives associated with female students at my son&amp;rsquo;s school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bio: Stacy Lansey is the Data Science Analyst at Warby Parker. She came to this role from a background in real estate and finance and is speaking about her experiences learning R in this role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though we&amp;rsquo;ll be remote at least through the end of 2020, R-Ladies NYC doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to lose the magic of meetups, where we get to network, socialize, meet new people, and make connections. For our August meetup, we&amp;rsquo;ll be hosting a networking social event where we&amp;rsquo;ll utilize breakout rooms to allow participants to connect (or re-connect) with other members of our community in smaller groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event will be hosted over Zoom, and the link will be available on this Meetup page and sent to all attendees at noon on the day of the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;agenda&#34;&gt;Agenda:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7-7:10: Welcome and R-Ladies NYC Announcements&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7:10-8:30: Breakout room chats (3-5 people, and we&amp;rsquo;ll provide some topics if that helps!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.meetup.com/rladies-newyork/events/272538491/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Meetup event&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Authors of &amp;ldquo;Build a Career in Data Science&amp;rdquo; Emily Robinson and Jacqueline Nolis will read selections from their book and discuss why they were meaningful and what thinking went into making it. In this session you’ll learn about some of the higher-level thinking that went into designing a book to help people excel in their data science careers, as well as hear stories from Emily and Jacqueline’s pasts that ended up shaping the narrative. After Emily and Jacqueline discuss their book, the floor will open so anyone can ask their data science career questions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event will be hosted over Zoom, and the link will be available on this Meetup page and sent to all attendees at noon on the day of the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;agenda&#34;&gt;Agenda:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7-7:05 pm: R-Ladies NYC Announcements&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7:05-7:40: Emily &amp;amp; Jacqueline talk about their book&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;speaker-bios&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaker Bios&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emily Robinson is a senior data scientist at Warby Parker, where she works on a centralized team tackling some of the company&amp;rsquo;s projects. She previously worked at DataCamp, where she built and ran their experimentation analytics system, and at Etsy, where she worked with their search team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jacqueline Nolis is a principal data scientist at Brightloom where she creates models to help restaurants and retailers improve the customer experience. She has a PhD in Industrial Engineering, and has over a decade of experience with helping companies use data, ranking from DSW to Airbnb.
