&lt;p&gt;For our October Meetup, we welcome Liz Hare, who will lead a workshop titled &amp;ldquo;Writing Meaningful Alt-Texts for Data Visualizations in R.&amp;rdquo; Liz will introduce &amp;ldquo;alt-text&amp;rdquo; and offer guidance on best practices. Alt-text is important to incorporated into your work not only to adhere to accessibility laws but also to ensure your work reaches everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the workshop, Liz will give the audience an opportunity to share their own data visualizations and discuss how they could be improved with alt-text. So, &lt;strong&gt;please bring a data visualization to share with the group!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presentation is available on Liz&amp;rsquo;s GitHub (for the latest slides, use this link right before the event): &lt;a href=&#34;https://LizHareDogs.github.io/RLadiesNYAltText&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://LizHareDogs.github.io/RLadiesNYAltText&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instructor Biography:
Liz Hare is a quantitative geneticist focusing on working dog behavior, health, and welfare. As a blind R user, she works on inclusion and accessibility of software and events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;details&#34;&gt;Details&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fill out this brief form by Thursday, September 1st to submit your application to be a speaker!
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1vXC-iKiqCycnwD4sjqYMm9BgIOITHEvsPPdZBrVlEjg/edit&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1vXC-iKiqCycnwD4sjqYMm9BgIOITHEvsPPdZBrVlEjg/edit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lighting talks are five minute talks. You can talk about anything R, Tech, and/or Data Science related. Looking for ideas? How about talking about a cool package you found, how you use R in your company, a favorite learning resource, your journey into Data Science, or a side project you&amp;rsquo;ve been working on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would especially love to hear from people who&amp;rsquo;ve never presented at a meetup or conference before and/or those who still don&amp;rsquo;t feel confident speaking publicly. A lightning talk can be a great way to start out speaking, as it&amp;rsquo;s quick, low-prep, and fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interested in proposing a talk but want to brainstorm ideas, get feedback, or some encouragement? We&amp;rsquo;re here to help! You can join the #lightningtalks channel in our slack channel or email nyc@rladies.org. We would be happy to set up a time to talk with you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Presentations and Speakers &amp;mdash;
Tonight&amp;rsquo;s lineup of speakers is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Clara Wang: Using Shiny to Avoid Boring Tasks at Work&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2. Crystal Lewis: A Comparison of Packages to Generate Codebooks in R&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;3. Blaire Hamelehle: Mapmaking Data Stories&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4. Susmita Paul, Northwell Health: Logistic Regression in the Tidyverse&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;5. Natalia Andriychuk: Creating an R Center for Excellence in a large pharma company&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Twitter: @datascienceandi&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6. Daniela Cortez: Air Analytics&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;7. Dorota Rizik: Base R vs. Tidyverse: Regular Expression Edition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To celebrate the diversity in the R Community, we&amp;rsquo;re prioritizing presenters who identify as a minority gender (including but not limited to cis/trans women, trans men, non-binary, genderqueer, agender).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;details&#34;&gt;Details&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to come code and learn with us? For June’s NYC R-ladies meetup, we are planning a #TidyTuesday code-laboration event! This event will be held online via Zoom. Please register via the Google Form below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://forms.gle/RN5FkyEaRGnLbxx37&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://forms.gle/RN5FkyEaRGnLbxx37&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The zoom link will be emailed ONLY to those who register in advance via the form above the morning of the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ask participants to pick a TidyTuesday dataset from the month of May or June and create (or attempt to create!) a visualization of the dataset before the meetup. At the meetup, participants will have the opportunity to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Share something you learned in making the TidyTuesday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did you learn a new function in the process?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did you discover a new package?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did you learn something new with the data you explored?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Share your process or tips for making the TidyTuesday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What TidyTuesday tips do you have?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Share something you struggled with&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is a barrier you ran into while trying to create your TidyTuesday? We will work together to answer questions people ran into&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Share your visualization!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will showcase the visualizations and works-in-progress we made with each other!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you don’t have time to work on a #TidyTuesday before the meetup, &lt;strong&gt;we hope you will still join us to collaboratively learn and code with each other!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is #TidyTuesday?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TidyTuesday is a weekly social data project hosted by the R for Data Science community. Every Tuesday a new dataset is posted, and everyone is invited to explore and visualize the data. “The intent of Tidy Tuesday is to provide a safe and supportive forum for individuals to practice their wrangling and data visualization skills” (TidyTuesday repository on GitHub &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I see what other people have created?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People will often post their final TidyTuesday creations on twitter with the #TidyTuesday hashtag.&lt;/p&gt;

Male allies have been great supporters of our chapter and the R-Ladies mission to promote gender diversity in the R Community &amp;ndash; for which we are grateful! &amp;ndash; and we believe the best way male allies can support us this month is by honoring the need for and benefit of such a space.]&lt;/p&gt;
