&lt;h2 id=&#34;details&#34;&gt;Details&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our June event, R-Ladies Anna Sofia Kircher and Joyce Robbins will share short talks about using color palettes, themes, and schemes to improve data visualization in R.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event will be hosted over Zoom, and the link will be available on this Meetup page at noon on the day of the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agenda (times approximate):
7-7:05 pm: R-Ladies NYC Announcements
7:05-7:30: “ggplot and I” by Anna Sofia Kircher
7:30-7:55: “Does your color palette match your data?” by Joyce Robbins
7:55-8:15: Questions and wrap-up&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Talk Abstract &amp;mdash;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“ggplot and I”
Speaker: Anna Sofia Kircher&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract: This talk will be about how to use ggplot themes and how to personalize them for your purposes. This is motivated by my own obsession with colors and my own experience that different plots with different audiences respond differently to different themes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bio: Anna Sofia Kircher is the data scientist at Lendable and works with data of various fintechs in emerging and frontier markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Does your color palette match your data?”
Speaker: Joyce Robbins&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract: One of the most common graphical mistakes is choosing an inappropriate color scheme for your data. In this talk, I’ll explain how sequential, diverging and qualitative color schemes are each suited to a different type of data. We’ll then look at a variety of plots that could be improved with alternative color choices. My hope is that these examples will serve as conversation starters for a lively discussion on matching color to data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bio: Joyce Robbins (@jtrnyc) is a Lecturer in the Department of Statistics at Columbia University. She specializes in data visualization and statistical literacy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;details&#34;&gt;Details&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our April event, we will have two guest speakers. Megan Robertson will be talking about how to write production level data science code, while Natalie O&amp;rsquo;Shea will be discussing how to use the nyccensus package and how to wrangle/use census data for equity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event will be hosted over Zoom, and the link will be available on this Meetup page at noon on the day of the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agenda (times approximate):
6:05 - 6:10 pm: R-Ladies NYC Announcements
6:10 - 6:40 : Natalie&amp;rsquo;s talk on NYC Census data with time for Q&amp;amp;A
6:40-7pm: Megan&amp;rsquo;s talk on creating production level data science code with time for Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Talk Abstract &amp;mdash;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Introducing nyccensus: Leveraging Census Data for Equity in NYC&amp;rdquo;
Speaker: Natalie O&amp;rsquo;Shea&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract: This talk will introduce the nyccensus package and associated Shiny dashboard and share examples of how census data can be leveraged to help address equity issues. The nyccensus package is a simple data-sharing package meant to ease the pains of accessing and wrangling publicly-available response rate data from the 2020 Decennial Census as well as other relevant demographic data from the American Community Survey at various geographic levels in New York City. I will share some lessons learned and examples of how these data can be used to better understand and address equity issues in NYC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bio: Natalie O&amp;rsquo;Shea is a researcher and data visualization specialist with a passion for equity, accessibility, and human-centered design. She started her data science journey during graduate school, falling in love with all things R in her coursework and research. She was part of CUNY&amp;rsquo;s first Data for Public Good cohort before taking a position as a Community Outreach Data Analyst with the NYC Census 2020 initiative and then working as a Data Visualization Specialist at NYC Test &amp;amp; Trace Corps. She is currently working as a Data Visualization Analyst on the Research and Learning Engineering team at Edmentum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Creating Production Level Data Science Code&amp;rdquo;
Speaker: Megan Robertson&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Writing code is a big part of working as a data scientist. You write code throughout all stages of a project from exploratory data analysis to building models. This talk focuses on creating production code from a proof of concept analysis or model. How do you organize and adapt all the code created to get to a proof of concept? Do you feel overwhelmed by everything you need to do? At the end of this talk you’ll walk away with tips and strategies to make your own production code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bio: Megan Robertson is a Senior Data Scientist at Nike. She has multiple years of experience applying data science in retail settings. She first became interested in math and statistics through sports analytics, and wrote her Master’s thesis in collaboration with an NBA team. Her background includes training in Bayesian methodology, statistical modeling, machine learning and more. Megan has delivered multiple talks on various aspects of data science from building a career and project management to writing code. She is currently writing her first data science book, Mastering Communication in Data Science, in partnership with Manning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;details&#34;&gt;Details&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our March event, Dr. Connie Brett, the CEO, founder, &amp;amp; principal data scientist of Aggregate Genius, Inc. will talk to us about the Periscope package and enterprise-level Shiny apps!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event will be hosted over Zoom, and the link will be available on this Meetup page at noon on the day of the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agenda (times approximate):
6:05 - 6:10 pm: R-Ladies NYC Announcements
6:10 + : Connie&amp;rsquo;s talk on periscope with time for Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Talk Abstract &amp;mdash;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Focus on Content: Create Enterprise-Worthy Shiny Applications with Periscope&amp;rdquo;
Speaker: Dr. Connie Brett&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract: The periscope R package is a framework that you can use to significantly speed up your shiny development – whether you are just writing your first collaborative application or taking on a bigger project that will be deployed to many users. Periscope can significantly &amp;ldquo;up&amp;rdquo; your Shiny game by jump-starting development in a way that is flexible and robust. This lets you focus on the content of your application, as opposed to the mechanics (and those insidious pitfalls!) of building a shiny application for multiple users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bio: Dr. Connie Brett is the CEO, Founder, and Principal Data Scientist of Aggregate Genius Inc. located in BC, Canada. She is experienced in using many types of models and algorithms as well as architecting cutting-edge big-data analytics-integrated platforms. She has submitted publications and patents; contributes to and maintains R packages and frameworks (such as periscope) in the open-source community; and attends and speaks at industry events. With over 20 years spent focusing on producing solid analytical models, software and visualization tools – as well as custom IT solutions architecture – she continues to carry forward her passion for helping clients realize true business insights from analytics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;book-description&#34;&gt;Book Description&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data Science in Education Using R is the go-to reference for learning data science in the education field. The book answers questions like: What does a data scientist in education do? How do I get started learning R, the popular open-source statistical programming language? And what does a data analysis project in education look like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re just getting started with R in an education job, this is the book you’ll want with you. This book gets you started with R by teaching the building blocks of programming that you’ll use many times in your career. The book takes a &amp;ldquo;learn by doing&amp;rdquo; approach and offers eight analysis walkthroughs that show you a data analysis from start to finish, complete with code for you to practice with. The book finishes with how to get involved in the data science community and how to integrate data science in your education job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though we&amp;rsquo;ll be remote at least through the end of 2020, R-Ladies NYC doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to lose the magic of meetups, where we get to network, socialize, meet new people, and make connections. For our August meetup, we&amp;rsquo;ll be hosting a networking social event where we&amp;rsquo;ll utilize breakout rooms to allow participants to connect (or re-connect) with other members of our community in smaller groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event will be hosted over Zoom, and the link will be available on this Meetup page and sent to all attendees at noon on the day of the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;agenda&#34;&gt;Agenda:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7-7:10: Welcome and R-Ladies NYC Announcements&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7:10-8:30: Breakout room chats (3-5 people, and we&amp;rsquo;ll provide some topics if that helps!)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Authors of &amp;ldquo;Build a Career in Data Science&amp;rdquo; Emily Robinson and Jacqueline Nolis will read selections from their book and discuss why they were meaningful and what thinking went into making it. In this session you’ll learn about some of the higher-level thinking that went into designing a book to help people excel in their data science careers, as well as hear stories from Emily and Jacqueline’s pasts that ended up shaping the narrative. After Emily and Jacqueline discuss their book, the floor will open so anyone can ask their data science career questions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event will be hosted over Zoom, and the link will be available on this Meetup page and sent to all attendees at noon on the day of the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;agenda&#34;&gt;Agenda:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7-7:05 pm: R-Ladies NYC Announcements&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7:05-7:40: Emily &amp;amp; Jacqueline talk about their book&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7:40-8:15: Audience Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our very own R-Ladies NYC board members Erin Grand and Kaelen Medeiros will give two short talks this month on leading R trainings for coworkers and flexdashboard!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event will be hosted over Zoom, and the link will be available on this Meetup page and sent to all attendees at noon on the day of the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;agenda&#34;&gt;Agenda:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7-7:05 pm: R-Ladies NYC Announcements&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7:05-7:30: &amp;ldquo;Leading R Trainings for Coworkers&amp;rdquo; by Erin Grand&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7:30-7:55: &amp;ldquo;flexdashboard for Prototyping and Profit&amp;rdquo; by Kaelen Medeiros&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7:55-8:15: Questions and wrap-up&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;title-leading-r-trainings-for-coworkers&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title:&lt;/strong&gt; Leading R Trainings for Coworkers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;presenter-erin-grand&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Presenter:&lt;/strong&gt; Erin Grand&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; Erin has lead a set of 6+ R trainings for her coworkers ranging from &amp;ldquo;Introduction to Tidyverse&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Using SQL and R Together.&amp;rdquo; Leading such trainings, while using many of the same teaching skills, offer different challenges from teaching in a workshop or classroom setting. Erin will discuss the Why&amp;rsquo;s, How&amp;rsquo;s, and Best Practices she&amp;rsquo;s learned over the past few years of leading trainings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio:&lt;/strong&gt; Erin works as a Data Scientist at Uncommon Schools where she trains coworkers in R as well as maintaining two R packages. Prior to Uncommon, she worked as a Data Scientist at Crisis Text Line, and a software programmer at NASA while completing her Data Science Masters at Columbia University. Before data science, Erin researched star formation and taught introductory courses in astronomy and physics at the University of Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;title-flexdashboard-for-prototyping-and-profit&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title:&lt;/strong&gt; flexdashboard for Prototyping and Profit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;presenter-kaelen-medeiros&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Presenter:&lt;/strong&gt; Kaelen Medeiros&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; The flexdashboard package allows you to build Shiny dashboards quickly using a RMarkdown document. This is advantageous in situations where you need to prototype a data product (often a dashboard or interactive report) and need to sell stakeholders on the value of the product built. Kaelen will talk about the basics of using flexdashboard and then give tips on utilizing it to build data product MVPs (minimum viable products) to communicate vision to stakeholders, plus discuss flexdashboard extensions and how to go about converting your flexdash to a Shiny dashboard (if you&amp;rsquo;re ready or even need to!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio:&lt;/strong&gt; Kaelen is a data scientist at Medidata Solutions where they work as an R programmer on the microservices team. They&amp;rsquo;ve also worked at Spring Health, DataCamp, HERE Technologies, and have done a fair amount of R and Shiny consulting on the side. Kaelen was at various times a film theorist, preschool teacher, test prep tutor, videographer, and nanny before getting a MS in biostatistics from LSU Health Sciences Center in 2016 and starting to work as a statistician and data scientist. They have a cat named Scully and enjoy talking about podcats, aliens, data, and would love to see a photo of your pet if you&amp;rsquo;re sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our very own Ayanthi Gunawardana and R-Ladies Chicago board member Angela Li join us this month to talk spatial statistics in R!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event will be hosted over Zoom, and a link will be sent to all attendees at noon on the day of the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;agenda&#34;&gt;Agenda:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7-7:05 pm: R-Ladies NYC Announcements&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7:05-7:30: &amp;ldquo;Uncharted Territory: An Introduction to Making Clear and Accurate Maps&amp;rdquo; by Ayanthi Gunawardana&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7:30-7:55: &amp;ldquo;How to Be a Resilient Geospatial R useR: First Steps, Learning More, and the Spatial R-Ladies Community&amp;rdquo; by Angela Li&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7:55-8:15: Questions and wrap-up&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;title-uncharted-territory-an-introduction-to-making-clear-and-accurate-maps&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title:&lt;/strong&gt; Uncharted Territory: An Introduction to Making Clear and Accurate Maps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;presenter-ayanthi-gunawardana&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Presenter:&lt;/strong&gt; Ayanthi Gunawardana&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; Over the course of a decade, maps have gone from folded paper booklets inside the glove compartment of a car to having a map of the entire world inside everyone’s smartphone. As more spatial data becomes available, maps are no longer simple representations of places on Earth; maps now include visualizations of a wide range of newly available spatial datasets. We collect more and more data with location information, but does this mean that this information belongs on a map? I will cover some basic principles of good cartography and what to keep in mind when creating a map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio:&lt;/strong&gt; Ayanthi is a Data and Research Analyst at the New York City Department of Transportation, where she analyzes car crash data to inform street safety projects and street redesign. Ayanthi has a Masters in City and Regional Planning from Rutgers University, which sparked her interest in maps and data. When she&amp;rsquo;s not looking at maps, you can find Ayanthi at Brazilian Jiu Jitsu class (pre pandemic) or cooking something spicy (all the time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;title-how-to-be-a-resilient-geospatial-r-user-first-steps-learning-more-and-the-spatial-r-ladies-community&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title:&lt;/strong&gt; How to Be a Resilient Geospatial R useR: First Steps, Learning More, and the Spatial R-Ladies Community&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;presenter-angela-li&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Presenter:&lt;/strong&gt; Angela Li&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; Learning to work with geospatial data in R can be challenging, but the right resources and open-source community can help whether you’re starting out with spatial data or moving your spatial analysis workflow to R. I’ll cover how you can get started with geospatial analysis in R, common questions and challenges I’ve seen, and where you can turn when you get stuck. I’ll draw insights from my experiences working 1-on-1 with researchers, teaching and assisting with spatial R workshops, and fielding questions from the #rspatialchat Twitter hashtag. Finally, I’ll discuss next steps for R-Ladies in the #rspatial community and talk about how we can help each other become better spatial data practitioners together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio:&lt;/strong&gt; Angela is a researcher and the R Spatial Advocate at the Center for Spatial Data Science at the University of Chicago. She has a background in spatial analysis, econometrics, and public policy. Prior to her current position, she worked at a startup focused on mobility and conducted research on housing and demolition in Detroit. She is currently researching the opioid epidemic in America, working with public health experts to better understand access to treatment. She is passionate about creating opportunities for underrepresented minorities to advance their data science and spatial thinking skills, starting R-Ladies Chicago and the #rspatialchat hashtag on Twitter, among other projects. She is a huge fan of the New York Times crossword.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angela’s website is &lt;a href=&#34;angela-li.github.io&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;angela-li.github.io&lt;/a&gt;. You can also find her on Github at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/angela-li&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;@angela-li&lt;/a&gt; and Twitter &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/CivicAngela&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;@CivicAngela&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
