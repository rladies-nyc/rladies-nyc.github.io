Male allies have been great supporters of our chapter and the R-Ladies mission to promote gender diversity in the R Community &amp;ndash; for which we are grateful! &amp;ndash; and we believe the best way male allies can support us this month is by honoring the need for and benefit of such a space.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ll kick off the year with a hands-on working session where we&amp;rsquo;ll work together on our own projects or tutorials.
Come in curious about a subject or looking to make progress on a project you&amp;rsquo;re working on!
We&amp;rsquo;ll divide ourselves into groups who&amp;rsquo;ll be working on similar topics, and we&amp;rsquo;ll have prompts and tutorials at hand for those who don&amp;rsquo;t have a particular project in mind.
We believe that by collaborating with other R-Ladies who share your curiosity you’ll get much further than you would at home with google, and that even if you don’t have a set goal you’ll learn through sharing and receiving tips and tricks.</description>
