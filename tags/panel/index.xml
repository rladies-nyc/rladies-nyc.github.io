      <description>Details We are thrilled to host a series of experts to discuss their experiences working with different types of COVID-19 data, insights they&amp;rsquo;ve gleaned, and challenges they&amp;rsquo;ve encountered with these complex and rapidly evolving data.
This event will be hosted over Zoom; the link will be available on this page the morning of the event, and the passcode will be emailed to you. R-Ladies is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone.</description>
