Come in curious about a subject or looking to make progress on a project you&amp;rsquo;re working on!
We&amp;rsquo;ll divide ourselves into groups who&amp;rsquo;ll be working on similar topics, and we&amp;rsquo;ll have prompts and tutorials at hand for those who don&amp;rsquo;t have a particular project in mind.
We believe that by collaborating with other R-Ladies who share your curiosity you’ll get much further than you would at home with google, and that even if you don’t have a set goal you’ll learn through sharing and receiving tips and tricks.</description>

Lighting talks are five minute talks. You can talk about anything R, Tech, and/or Data Science related. Looking for ideas? How about talking about a cool package you found, how you use R in your company, a favorite learning resource, your journey into Data Science, or a side project you&amp;rsquo;ve been working on?</description>
