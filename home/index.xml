      <description>To ensure that our Meetups are accessible for all members of our community, we ask you to please review and implement the below presentation recommendations. Let us know if you have any questions.
Please email your slides to nyc@rladies.org by noon the day before your talk, or provide the link where you have them available online. It is fine if they represent a draft at this point, although let us know that &amp;ndash; in the event that someone requests the slides ahead of the Meetup for accessibility reasons, weâ€™d like to be able to share them.</description>
